# Website Portfolio
This is a website portfolio where I tried to make everything without AI, the only thing that used AI was quickly making the cors_server.py for development and testing.

## Description
It mainly uses a command line style, with some common functions available such as ls, cd, cat. 
Note, all of these functions are faked of course.
The main idea for this project is actually to learn anime.js, I came across it in a reel and wanted to try working with it.
The plan is to make it look cyberpunk with a startup animation and shutdown animation. Basically whatever makes it look cool to use or would be in the cyberpunk genre.

## Functions
- Command Line Style
- Switch between 3 display modes (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Scroll to auto-type
- Anime.js implementation
- Intentionally overengineered to handle future updating by simply modifying data.json

### What's with the different modes?
The 3 different modes correspond to levels of knowing how to use a command line.
- Beginner - Doesn't know how to use a command line at all. For this, the plan is to make a normal looking website portfolio
- Intermediate - Knows how to use a command line, may not know all the functions. For this, the plan is to implement scroll to auto-type; basically a set path to simply skim through
- Advanced - Lives and Breathes command line, explore all yourself, try and find edgecases (Please let me know if there's any)

## What's not done yet?
- Cat function
- Beginner and Intermediate mode
- Anime.js implementation

## To Run and Test
1. run python cors_server.py
2. then just open the main.html
